# Image Recognition System using CNN and Flask

## Project Description
This project is an Image Recognition Web Application that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into predefined object categories. Users can upload an image through a Flask web interface and receive real-time predictions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Flask
- NumPy
- HTML

## Dataset
CIFAR-10 dataset containing 10 object classes:
airplane, car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck.

## Features
- Image upload via web interface
- Real-time prediction
- CNN-based classification
- Simple and beginner-friendly structure

## Model Architecture
- Conv2D
- MaxPooling
- Flatten
- Dense layers
- Softmax output layer
